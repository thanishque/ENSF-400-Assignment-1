Assignment 1
This project demonstrates the creation of a Docker container for running a Python application that generates random text data.


text_gen.py
The text_gen.py script is a Python application that generates random text data. It performs the following tasks:

Checks if the file /serverdata/random.txt exists.
If the file exists, it reads and prints the existing content.
Generates 100 random characters of text data.
Writes the new data to the file /serverdata/random.txt.
Prints the new data.
Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for running the Python application. It performs the following steps:

Uses a Python base image.
Sets the working directory to /app.
Creates the directory /serverdata inside the container.
Copies the text_gen.py script into the container.
Sets the command to execute the text_gen.py script when the container starts.
Usage
Build the Docker Image:

Terminal
docker build -t assignment1 .
This command builds a Docker image with the tag assignment1 using the Dockerfile in the current directory (.). Make sure to run this command from the directory where your Dockerfile is located.

Run the Docker Container:

Terminal
docker run -it -v servervol:/serverdata assignment1
